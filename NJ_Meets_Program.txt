Breakout Session 2: 

Communicating Your Value - Elevating the Role of Meeting Professionals & Suppliers with Speaker Corrine Statia-Thomas

Session Description: 

Meeting planners and their supplier partners are the invisible architects of successful events. Yet too often, their contributions are seen as “logistics” rather than strategic impact. 

This interactive session challenges meeting professionals to stop undervaluing themselves and provides practical tools to reframe their work in terms of outcomes, not tasks. 

Through real-world examples, collaborative exercises, and guided reflection, participants will uncover the hidden strategic, operational, and human value they bring to every event. 

They’ll practice reframing “I booked a hotel” into “I secured $25,000 in savings, reduced risk, and enhanced attendee engagement.” 

Attendees will also draft a personal 30-second value pitch to communicate their worth confidently to clients and employers.

For independent planners, we’ll also touch on pricing your services — how to shift from hourly or task-based fees toward value-based pricing that reflects expertise, risk management, and ROI delivered.

Participants will leave not only more confident in their value, but equipped with language, tools, and frameworks to make that value visible. 

Handouts will also be provided.

Learning Outcomes 

Identify the strategic, operational, and experiential value they deliver as meeting professionals. 
Reframe tasks into measurable outcomes when communicating with clients or employers. 
Develop and deliver a personal value pitch in under 30 seconds.

Main Stage Session

Gather for a featured presentation delivering timely insights and high-impact content from the leading voice of Dr. Aurora Dawn Benton with her session Food Waste Prevention vs. Treatment: Shifting our Mentality for Impact

Session Description: 

Solving the food-waste problem must start with prevention, yet our efforts focus on treatment (like composting and donating). Why do we produce waste in the first place and what prevents us from having a prevention mindset? This session delivers practical and actionable takeaways that will yield measurable results.

Dr. Aurora Dawn Benton has spent nearly a decade leading hospitality and events industry pilots and research on the topic of food waste. She has trained thousands of planners and venue staff on a wide spectrum of social and environmental issues facing our industry. The common theme across this body of work is her approach to sustainability. Aurora is known for making overwhelming topics approachable. She recognizes sustainability is one of many priorities in planners’ and venue teams’ complex world, so she has distilled best practices to the most realistic and impactful actions you can take. 

In this session, which focuses on prevention, you will get steps to immediately apply to menu and meal planning, reducing food waste while enhancing guest experience. She emphasizes the opportunity to improve collaboration among planners and venues and shares a plethora of real-world examples from her years of field work and food waste audits. Through these case studies and practical steps, Aurora empowers you to activate and lead change among your teams, clients, and venue partners.  

Learning Outcomes: 

Identify the treatment options (compost and donation) to require and implement at all events. 
Prioritize the most wasteful F&B items and menu types to begin the food waste prevention journey. 
Utilize attendee demographics and photo audits to develop trends and thresholds for better food and beverage management.

Breakout Session 1: 

Risk Management: Five Things You Can Do Right Now (to better protect your meeting, your attendees, and your organization) with Speaker, Tyra Warner.

Session Description: 

Even if your organization has a risk management plan, chances are good that it does not adequately cover your meetings. Coming up with a risk management plan for each and every meeting can be a daunting task. But what if you could identify five things that you could do right away to better protect your attendees, your meeting, and your organization? You can! In this session, five tools (and numerous resources) will be shared that—if implemented right away—will improve your risk management practices starting with your very next meeting. Examples, case studies, and templates will be shared. Participants will be encouraged to share their experiences and best practices in risk management as well. 

 After attending this session, participants will be able to:

Identify five risk management practices that can be used to minimize the probability that a risk will occur or minimize the consequences if it does occur.

Modify the way events are planned to incorporate risk management measures into the basic process.

Coordinate risk management roles among planners, facilities, and vendors.

Breakout Session 2: 

From Basics to Brilliance: Generative AI in the Meetings Industry with Speaker, Jim Spellos.

While many are fearful that AI will replace the need for many, the reality is much more nuanced than what many are preaching, though the skill sets and tasks required are evolving. Attend this session to better understand the foundations of Generative AI and how they impact your career moving forward
